# Messages From the Stars

This challenge consisted of 6241 sequential tones each where a one is represented by 8292 htz and a zero is represented by 8092 htz.

This challenge was inspired by the [Arecibo message]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message} sent in 1974 to the globular cluster Messier 13 in the hope it would be received by intelligent life.

# Solve

6241 is a semi prime which has a root of 79. This should give the player a hint to arrange the image into a square. Once it has been arranged into a square the image is shown.

The solve script was written in Matlab. Translating it to python is left as an exercise to the reader.
