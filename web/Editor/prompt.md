I took a few hours to create a simple HTML/CSS previewer system. Since there's no way to add JavaScript then my server should be safe, right? 

Grab the flag from the `http://localhost:5000/flag.txt` file on the server to show that this isn't the case. 

The flag is in the standard format. Good luck!
